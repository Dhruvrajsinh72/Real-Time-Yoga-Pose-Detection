Real-Time Yoga Pose Detection
This project is a real-time yoga pose detection system built using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, implemented with the Python programming language. The system leverages state-of-the-art computer vision models to identify and classify yoga poses accurately, providing real-time feedback to users. This project aims to promote fitness and wellness by using technology to assist in learning and perfecting yoga poses.

Features
Real-time Pose Detection: The system processes live video feed and detects yoga poses with high accuracy.
Pose Classification: Recognizes and categorizes various yoga poses.
Feedback Mechanism: Offers real-time feedback to improve posture and alignment.
Scalable Framework: Easily extendable to include more poses or integrate additional features.
Cross-Platform Support: Can be run on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) with a webcam.
Project Highlights
State-of-the-Art Models: Utilizes advanced deep learning models like OpenPose, MediaPipe, or custom-trained convolutional neural networks for pose estimation.
Real-Time Performance: Optimized for real-time inference using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ONNX.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a clean and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line tool for users to interact with the system.
Customization Options: Easy to add or modify yoga poses for personalized use cases.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras
Pose Estimation Tools: MediaPipe Pose, OpenPose, or a custom-trained model
Libraries:
OpenCV for real-time video processing
NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Use Cases
Yoga Training: Helps beginners learn yoga poses with real-time feedback.
Health & Wellness Apps: Can be integrated into fitness applications.
Educational Tools: Assists in teaching yoga and biomechanics in educational settings.
Rehabilitation Support: Guides users recovering from physical injuries in performing therapeutic yoga poses.
How It Works
Input: Captures live video feed using a webcam or camera.
Pose Detection: Uses a pose estimation model to detect key points (e.g., elbows, knees, shoulders).
Pose Classification: Classifies the detected pose into predefined yoga poses.
Feedback: Provides real-time feedback on pose alignment and suggests corrections if needed.

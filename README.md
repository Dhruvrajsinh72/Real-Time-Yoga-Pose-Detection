# Real-Time Yoga Pose Detection

This project is a **real-time yoga pose detection system** built using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques, implemented with the **Python programming language**. The system leverages state-of-the-art computer vision models to identify and classify yoga poses accurately, providing real-time feedback to users. This project aims to promote fitness and wellness by using technology to assist in learning and perfecting yoga poses.

## Features

- **Real-time Pose Detection**: The system processes live video feed and detects yoga poses with high accuracy.
- **Pose Classification**: Recognizes and categorizes various yoga poses.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Offers real-time feedback to improve posture and alignment.
- **Scalable Framework**: Easily extendable to include more poses or integrate additional features.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Can be run on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) with a webcam.

## Project Highlights

- **State-of-the-Art Models**: Utilizes advanced deep learning models like OpenPose, MediaPipe, or custom-trained convolutional neural networks for pose estimation.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for real-time inference using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ONNX.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a clean and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line tool for users to interact with the system.
- **Customization Options**: Easy to add or modify yoga poses for personalized use cases.

## Technology Stack

1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras
3. **Pose Estimation Tools**: MediaPipe Pose, OpenPose, or a custom-trained model
4. **Libraries**:
   - OpenCV for real-time video processing
   - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
5. **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Use Cases

- **Yoga Training**: Helps beginners learn yoga poses with real-time feedback.
- **Health & Wellness Apps**: Can be integrated into fitness applications.
- **Educational Tools**: Assists in teaching yoga and biomechanics in educational settings.
- **Rehabilitation Support**: Guides users recovering from physical injuries in performing therapeutic yoga poses.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Captures live video feed using a webcam or camera.
2. **Pose Detection**: Uses a pose estimation model to detect key points (e.g., elbows, knees, shoulders).
3. **Pose Classification**: Classifies the detected pose into predefined yoga poses.
4. **Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback on pose alignment and suggests corrections if needed.
